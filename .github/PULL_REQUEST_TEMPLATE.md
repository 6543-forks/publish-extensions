## What type of PR is this?

- [ ] ‚ú® Adding a new extension
- [ ] üìù Updating the scripts and/or publishing workflows

## Can't manually publish

For the sake of efficiency and simplicity, the easiest way to publish an extension is by having it published by its official maintainers, for more info about this please refer to the [README](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions#when-to-add-an-extension). If you are the maintainer of this very extension, instead of creating a PR, publish the extension according to the [Publishing Extensions](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Publishing-Extensions) guide in our project's wiki.

- [ ] I have tried reaching out to the extension maintainers about publishing this extension to OpenVSX
